## Introduction
As we know that an AI system involves two major pillars, one is code(model + algorithm) and the other is data. In a recent [interview]((https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/panes/HoloViews.html)) Andrew Ng mentioned the importance of high quality data.
Through this project we would like to focus on the data aspect of an AI system.
The project aims to demonstrate the improvement in model performance using Data Quality Metrics and Data Flywheel concept.
